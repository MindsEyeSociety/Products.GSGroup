GroupServer Group Product

Groups are strange, as they are split into three parts.
  1. The user-group is handled by the CustomUserFolder.
  2. The mailing list, and the Web representation of posts and topics, is
     handled by XWFMailingListManager.
  3. The Web-interface to the group is handled by this product.
